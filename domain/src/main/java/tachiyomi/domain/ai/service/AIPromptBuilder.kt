The final result should look exactly like **classic anime production art**, with no soft blending or gradients.",
        "Soft & Painterly Digital" to "Color using a **soft-edge brush** and **smooth, gradual blending** between all colors and tones to achieve a highly voluminous and realistic effect. Emphasize complex lighting and subtle color variation (subsurface scattering) for a **fine art illustration** feel.",
        "Watercolor Translucent Wash" to "Color using **highly translucent and thin layers** of color, simulating the texture of paper and the natural bleeding of paint. Allow the black lines to show through clearly. Shadows should be created by **layering multiple thin washes** of color, resulting in a soft, bright, and delicate appearance.",
        "Vibrant Copic Marker Style" to "Apply colors in **solid, highly saturated fields** to mimic alcohol marker application. Use a smooth colorless blender effect for the transitions between mid-tones and highlights. The overall look must be **bright, clean, and graphically vibrant**, with a visible emphasis on crisp edges.",
        "Monochromatic Cyanotype" to "The entire panel must be rendered using a **single-color palette** consisting only of **shades of deep blue, cyan, and white**. Shadows should be rendered through denser areas of blue, creating a classic, limited-palette illustration or **cyanotype print** aesthetic."
