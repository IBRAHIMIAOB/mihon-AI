## Mihon AI Coloring

This specialized fork of Mihon is dedicated to integrating AI-powered features, primarily focusing on **AI Coloring** for manga panels.

**Our Goal:** We encourage the community to test, develop, and refine these features so they can eventually be merged into the main [Mihon app](https://github.com/mihonapp/mihon).

### Recommended Models

To get the best results, we recommend using the following Gemini models via OpenRouter. Prices are approximate:

| Model ID | Description | Price (approx.) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `google/gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview`<br>`google/gemini-2.5-flash-image` | **Cheap & Fast**<br>Good for bulk coloring. | ~$0.03 / image |
| `google/gemini-3-pro-image-preview` | **High Quality**<br>Expensive but provides better detail and coloring. | $0.1 - $1.3 / image |

> [!NOTE]
> For more models and details, visit [OpenRouter Models](https://openrouter.ai/models?fmt=cards&input_modalities=image%2Ctext&output_modalities=image).

### How to Use

To use the AI coloring features, follow these steps:

1.  **Get an API Key**: Obtain an API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys).
2.  **Add Credits**: Ensure you have added credits to your OpenRouter account.
3.  **Configure in App**:
    - Go to **Settings > AI Coloring**.
    - Enter your **API Key**.
    - Enable **AI Coloring**.
    - Enter a **Model ID** from the list above.
4.  **Coloring Methods**:

    **Method A: Automatic Chapter Coloring (Bulk)**
    - Download a chapter with **AI Coloring** enabled in settings.
    - The entire chapter will be colored during the download process.
    - *Note: This applies coloring to all pages automatically without individual guidelines.*

    **Method B: Individual Panel Coloring (Guided)**
    - Long-press a panel or open the menu while reading.
    - Select **AI Coloring** for the specific panel.
    - You can provide **guidelines** (scribbles/lines) to direct the AI on how to color specific areas (e.g., hair color, clothes).
    - This allows for higher consistency and control.

### Known Issues
- **Bulk Downloading**: Downloading a whole chapter with AI enabled may not be the best approach for everyone due to cost and varying quality.
- **Image Quality**: Quality can degrade with cheaper/weaker image generation models.
- **Consistency**: Colors may not be consistent from one panel to another (e.g., character hair changing color).

### Features & Roadmap
- **Motion Panels**: We are exploring Image-to-Video to create moving panels. *Currently limited by OpenRouter support.*
- **Color Consistency**: Future updates aim to include a "Color Log" or "Character Profile" system. This would categorize characters (e.g., `Character_Name_SkinColor = White`) to maintain consistent coloring across pages.
- **Contribution**: We welcome all contributions to improve these features!
